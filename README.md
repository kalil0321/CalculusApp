# CalculusApp
Trying to make a Calculus toolbox. Doing it on my free time. Any suggestion or improvements are welcome. 
I'm really interested in mathematics and calculus / linear algebra. I realised that having really good tools can help.
I can relate because I'm all the time performing computation on my Ti-nspire which really give me an advantage for mathematics. 
This app is for helping people to verify their results. I'm planning to add many things such as Linear Algebra, Latex visualizer...
If you want to be apart of this project, I would really be happy.
